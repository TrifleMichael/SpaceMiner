FILES:

Main - main loop and main loop variables
Classes - classes and functions
ObjectLists - lists to keep track of objects
Settings

CLASSES:

Each class is self contained which means there is no inheritance nor class containing classes  (except for lotnik class).

Lotnik class contains lotnik_states class which contains information about ship health and keys currently pressed, and weapons class which containes weapon information.

MAIN CONCEPT:

For object X the definition and function used to generate instance of X in contained in Classes.

The engine uses a pipeline described below to create and handle objects:

Firstly the instance is generated by mentioned function and the reference to the instance is then placed in a list which contains all references to objects of a given class.

The ObjectLists contains all object lists.

Secondly all object lists are placed in lists as described by their properties.
For example all object lists are placed in draw_list as all objects require to be drawn.

This allows for easy removal of object instances by removing the reference to it from its class list.
Ex. removing a asteroid from asteroid_list removes all further references to that asteroid.
