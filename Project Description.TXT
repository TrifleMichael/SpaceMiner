MAIN CONCEPT:

The engine uses a pipeline described below to create and handle objects:

Firstly the instance or instances are generated by a function and the reference to those instances is then placed in a list, which contains all references to objects of a given class.
For example asteroid_list contains all references to asteroids.

Secondly all object lists are placed in lists as described by their properties, one object list can be contained in multiple property lists.
For example asteroid_list is  stored both in draw_list and movable_list as it has the properties of both.

This method allows for easy removal of object instances by simply removing the original reference to it from its class list.
